    "# [Introduction](#introduction)  \n",
    "This lesson is centered around a fundamentally important concept in the theory of quantum information, which is that of a purification of a state. A purification of a quantum state, represented by a density matrix $\\rho$ is a pure state of a larger compound system that leaves us with $\\rho$ when the rest of the compound system is traced out. As we'll see, every state $\\rho$ has a purification, provided that the portion of the compound system that gets traced out is large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's both common and useful to consider purifications of states when reasoning about them. Intuitively speaking, quantum state vectors are simpler mathematical objects than density matrices, and we can often conclude interesting things about density matrices by thinking about them as representing parts of larger systems whose states are pure — and therefore simpler (at least in some regards). This is an example of a dilation in mathematics, where something relatively complicated is obtained by restricting or reducing something larger but simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson also discusses the fidelity between two quantum states, which is a value that quantifies the similarity between the states. We'll see how fidelity is defined by a mathematical formula and discuss how it connects to the notion of a purification through Uhlmann's theorem."

    "\n",
    "The pure state $ |\\psi\\rangle \\langle\\psi| $, expressed as a density matrix rather than a quantum state vector, is also commonly referred to as a purification of $ \\rho $ when the equation in the definition is true, but we'll generally use the term to refer to a quantum state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *purification* is also used more generally when the ordering of the systems is reversed, when the names of the systems and states are different (of course), and when there are more than two systems. For instance, if $ |\\psi\\rangle $ is a quantum state vector representing a pure state of a compound system $ (A, B, C) $, and the equation  \n",

For the purposes of this lesson, however, we'll focus on the specific form described in the definition. Properties and facts concerning purifications, according to this definition, can typically be generalized to more than two systems by re-ordering and partitioning the systems into two compound systems, one playing the role of $ X $ and the other playing the role of $ Y $.\n",

    "Suppose that $ X $ and $ Y $ are any two systems and $ \\rho $ is a given state of $ X $. We will prove that there exists a quantum state vector $ |\\psi\\rangle $ of $ (X, Y) $ that *purifies* $ \\rho $ — which is another way of saying that $ |\\psi\\rangle $ is a purification of $ \\rho $ — provided that the system $ Y $ is large enough. In particular, if $ Y $ has at least as many classical states as $ X $, then a purification of this form necessarily exists for every state $ \\rho $. Fewer classical states of $ Y $ are required for some states $ \\rho $; in general, $ \\mathrm{rank}(\\rho) $ classical states of $ Y $ are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a quantum state vector of $ (X, Y) $ that purifies $ \\rho $.\n",

There's actually no need to include the terms corresponding to the zero eigenvalues of $ \\rho $ in the sum, which allows us to alternatively choose $ n = \\mathrm{rank}(\\rho) $ and $ p_0, \\ldots, p_{n-1} $ to be the non-zero eigenvalues of $ \\rho $. This is the minimum value of $ n $ for which an expression of $ \\rho $ taking the form above exists.\n",

    "1. Assume Alice and Bob only perform unitary operations or introduce new initialized systems.\n",
    "2. The protocol must allow Bob to hold a quantum system whose reduced state is:\n",
    "   - $ \\rho_0 $ if Alice committed to 0.\n",
