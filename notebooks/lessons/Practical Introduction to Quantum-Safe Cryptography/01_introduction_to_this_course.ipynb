    "## Course Introduction\n",
    "This training is designed for both expert and non-expert developers who want to learn about how quantum computing poses a risk to existing cryptography as new quantum algorithms are able to break existing encryption schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the default information is geared towards individuals with programming knowledge but limited or no experience in cryptography or quantum concepts. Practical Python examples are given which demonstrate the mathematical principles of cryptography, and can be used for some experimentation to improve understanding. This also caters to those seeking a high-level overview of quantum cryptography's workings and its significance in the modern world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers desiring a deeper understanding of both quantum physics concepts and cryptography should explore our expandable sections and presentations, which delve into the foundational mathematical concepts of this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this course, readers will learn how even today's data is at risk as it can be collected now, and decrypted later. It will demonstrate how our existing algorithms are compromised and introduce the innovative techniques which protect against such threats through an agile approach."

    "The Python code has been run already so that readers browsing the text can see the results without additional steps. However, and in particular for those with an interest in software development, you are encouraged to run these examples yourself. You can also experiment with input parameters and explore the principles in an experimental way.\n",
