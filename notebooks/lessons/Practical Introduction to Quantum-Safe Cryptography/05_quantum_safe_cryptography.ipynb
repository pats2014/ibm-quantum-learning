    "## Introduction to Quantum-safe Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Since quantum computers represent a distinct and potentially more powerful paradigm for computing than the classical computers in use today, cryptographic security needs to be reassessed for a world where quantum computers may proliferate, enabling new cryptographic attacks that would not be possible using classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attacks may occur in future on data that is being transmitted or stored now known as harvest now, decrypt later, so it is not sufficient to wait until the required systems are available, but to make changes now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) encompasses efforts to identify and develop cryptographic schemes that can withstand attacks both from quantum and classical computing systems. This is also sometimes called quantum-resistant, or post-quantum cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier lessons, we discussed some of the potential security risks that the development of general-purpose quantum computers poses to a number of traditional cryptographic primitives such as symmetric key algorithms, cryptographic hash functions, and asymmetric key algorithms. Additionally, we mentioned cryptographically relevant quantum algorithms and the protocols they impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the most significant impacts of quantum algorithms occur in the context of asymmetric key cryptography, where Shor's algorithm offers a polynomial-time solution to the prime factoring and discrete logarithm problems. Therefore, asymmetric cryptosystems based on factoring and discrete logarithms need to be replaced by new quantum-safe cryptography schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to the symmetric key and cryptographic hashing protocols impacted by the Grover and BHT algorithms, where the quantum speedups are not super-polynomial. Therefore, in this latter case, existing algorithms such as AES and SHA-256 can be fortified at least in the medium term by ensuring sufficiently long key and hash lengths.\n"

    "### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, the computational complexity class NP (non-deterministic polynomial time) plays an important role. This class consists of decision problems for which proposed solutions can be verified in polynomial time using a deterministic Turing machine (DTM). The importance of NP stems from the fact that it is conjectured to consist of many computational problems that cannot be solved efficiently by both classical and quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first generation of successful asymmetric key cryptosystems developed in the 1970s based their security on mathematical problems such as prime factorization and discrete logarithms that are now conjectured to belong to the NP-intermediate subclass of NP. This subclass consists of problems that are believed not to have polynomial-time solutions on DTMs but at the same time are also not as hard as the hardest problems in NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter belong to the subclass NP-complete. Following Shor's algorithm in the 1990s, it became clear that at least some NP-intermediate problems are amenable to efficient solutions on quantum computers that are not DTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, modern quantum-safe cryptography schemes are based on NP-complete problems or related NP-hard problems, which currently are not known to be solvable efficiently even on quantum computers.\n"

    "### Average vs Worst-case Hardness\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many known NP-hard problems, not every such problem is suitable as a basis for cryptographic security. In this context, the notion of average-case hardness is useful for cryptography. A problem is average-case hard if most instances of the problem drawn randomly from some distribution are hard, whereas a problem is worst-case hard if it is hard only on some isolated worst-case instances. Quantum-safe cryptologists therefore search for mathematical problems that satisfy the assumption of average-case hardness and employ theoretical tools such as worst-case to average-case reductions to identify suitable protocols whose security and efficiency can be guaranteed.\n"

    "### Mathematical Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptologists have put forth a number of different mathematical structures that satisfy the necessary hardness requirements as potential candidates for quantum-safe migration of asymmetric key cryptosystems. Some well-known families include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lattice-based cryptography**: This class of algorithms relies on the hardness of problems such as the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP) in lattice structures. Notable lattice-based schemes include NTRU and Learning with Errors (LWE).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code-based cryptography**: This type of cryptography is based on the difficulty of decoding a general linear code. The most notable example is the McEliece cryptosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multivariate cryptography**: These systems involve equations of multiple variables over a finite field. A well-known system in this category is the HFE (Hidden Field Equations) scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hash-based cryptography**: These are cryptographic systems that use only cryptographic hash functions. They are often used for digital signatures, like the Merkle signature scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Isogeny-based cryptography**: These systems are based on the difficulty of certain problems in the algebraic structure of elliptic curves. Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is an example.\n"

    "Recognizing the potential impact of quantum computing on current cryptographic systems, NIST initiated a program to standardize quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms in 2016 using a process similar to the one NIST followed to standardize the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the early 2000s. In an open and transparent process involving security domain stakeholders, several QSC candidates were submitted for evaluation, and following a six-year review process, NIST announced a list of four finalists to become a part of NIST’s quantum-safe cryptographic standard.\n"

    "### Lattices\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of what a lattice is in the world around us. The Eiffel Tower (Paris), or Birds-nest stadium (Beijing). Those structures have many linked elements which can be thought of as a series of points joined together along straight lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamonds are another form of lattice. There is a clear, repeating structure of Carbon atoms. They are then effectively joined together by atomic bonds; and this structure that is formed is what gives diamond its unique properties. However, different crystal structures can have very different layouts (can be thought of as our lattice structure), and therefore ends up with distinct features. Hence, lattices serve as the foundational mathematical framework that dictates the unique traits of different structures which we use in cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple mathematical terms, a lattice can be thought of as a collection of regularly spaced points that repeat at fixed intervals. To describe how these points are positioned relative to each other, we use vectors. The specific arrangement of these vectors, which defines the layout of the lattice, is referred to as the **basis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a box of toy construction bricks, and you want to build various objects with the same set of pieces. Each unique object you create requires a specific arrangement, and the way you choose and arrange the bricks serves as the basis for constructing different objects. If you change the selection or arrangement of bricks, you get a different object with distinct characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in a lattice, the **basis** is like the set of atomic building blocks that define the lattice's structure. Depending on how you arrange these building blocks (atoms or points) in the lattice, you can create various lattice structures with different properties. Just as changing the toy construction brick pieces changes the object you build, altering the basis changes the lattice's characteristics and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that lattices are not limited to two or three dimensions; they can extend to higher dimensions, and in fields like cryptography, they may involve 1000s or more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▼ Mathematical description of lattices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given $n$ linearly independent vectors $\\mathcal{A} = \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_n \\mid \\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\}$, the lattice $\\mathcal{L}$ generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is the set of integer linear combinations $\\mathcal{L} = \\left\\{ \\sum_i c_i \\mathbf{v}_i \\mid c_i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\right\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A basis $B$ of a lattice $\\mathcal{L}$ is any set of linearly independent vectors $B = \\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{b}_n\\}$ that spans the lattice i.e., $\\mathcal{L}(B) = \\left\\{ \\sum_i z_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid z_i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\right\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importantly, the basis for a given lattice is not unique. Two different basis sets $B, B'$ can describe the same lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every basis is unique — it may just be a different perspective on the same structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an important concept in lattice-based cryptography, that of **lattice-basis reduction**. This is the process of taking a given lattice and attempting to find a *good basis* comprising short, nearly orthogonal vectors.\n",

    "Given a lattice $\\mathcal{L}$ embedded in a vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ with norm $\\mathcal{N}$, the [SVP]25 asks for the shortest non-zero vector in $\\mathcal{L}$ as measured by $\\mathcal{N}$, that is, find a vector $v$ such that its length $\\|v\\|_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\min_{v \\in \\mathcal{L} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v'\\|_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\lambda(\\mathcal{L})$.\n",

    "Ajtai also demonstrated that there exists a worst-case to average-case reduction for the shortest vector problem, laying the foundation for its use in cryptography."

    "### IND-CPA and IND-CCA Security in Lattice-based Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson on Symmetric Key Cryptography, we introduced the notion of **semantic security** or **IND-CPA security** which refers to **indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional cryptosystems whether symmetric (such as AES) or asymmetric (such as RSA) use deterministic functions to implement encryption operations. This means that a given plaintext, combined with a given encryption key will always encrypt to the same ciphertext. Such deterministic cryptosystems are vulnerable to **chosen plaintext attack** whereby an adversary is able to extract information by requesting encryptions of arbitrary plaintexts of their choice from the deterministic encryption function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve IND-CPA security in this context, **additional randomness** is introduced at encryption time either through *initialization vectors* or *padding*. For instance AES is only IND-CPA secure when used in  \n",
    "Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) modes of operation that use random initialization vectors. Similarly with RSA, **OAEP padding** is needed to ensure IND-CPA security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, lattice-based schemes for encryption are inherently randomized due to the problem definition itself. In particular, in the LWE based encryption scheme outlined above, there are two distinct elements of randomness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(1)** The error (or noise) $\\varepsilon$ drawn from the distribution $\\chi$  \n",
    "- **(2)** The random binary vectors $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\{0,1\\}^N$ used for encrypting each bit in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors $\\varepsilon$ contribute to the security of the public key, ensuring that it's computationally hard to deduce the secret key $\\mathbf{s}$. The random binary vectors $\\mathbf{r}$ on the other hand provide the essential randomness needed for making repeated encryptions of the same plaintext bit non-deterministic. Thus LWE based schemes are considered IND-CPA secure without the need for external mechanisms such as padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cryptosystems aim to achieve so called **IND-CCA** security which stands for **indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attack**. In this setting the adversary has the ability to obtain decryptions of a non-trivial set of ciphertexts of their choosing with the aim of extracting information to subsequently break the cryptosystem. A scheme is IND-CCA secure if, even with this capability, the adversary cannot do better than random guessing when trying to distinguish encrypted messages. IND-CCA is a stronger security notion than IND-CPA and subsumes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum safe KEMs such as **Kyber** are designed to be IND-CCA secure. This is achieved in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An IND-CPA secure public key encryption (PKE) scheme is defined. In the case of Kyber such a PKE is based on **Module-LWE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform (FO) is applied to obtain a CCA-secure KEM. The FO transformation is a generic method to convert encryption schemes that are IND-CPA secure into ones that are IND-CCA secure. For details we refer readers to the [original papers](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/634.pdf).\n",

    "## Hybrid Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid cryptography refers to using quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can help address 2 issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Existing standards may mandate specific algorithms to be used for encryption, or that such algorithms are in some way approved. To add quantum safety, encryption could first be done using the regular algorithm, but then further protected by a quantum-safe algorithm, whilst still meeting required standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quantum algorithms are new, and further analysis is needed to ensure they are indeed safe and correct. For example one of the initial algorithms shortlisted by NIST was subsequently cracked and proven to be insecure. To mitigate this risk, encryption can be done both using a standard, well-reviewed, secure (apart from quantum!) algorithm, in addition to a post-quantum algorithm.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The migration to quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) of asymmetric key cryptosystems is necessitated by the expected advent of quantum computers that can break traditional asymmetric key algorithms predicated on the classical hardness of NP-intermediate problems. QSC is conjectured to be robust to quantum attacks because its security is based on NP-hard problems, which generally cannot be efficiently solved even with quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, hard problems rooted in the theory of mathematical lattices such as the learning with errors (LWE) problem have emerged as leading contenders for QSC standardization. In particular, the CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms, based on modular lattices, are well positioned as near-term alternatives to popular asymmetric key protocols like RSA, Elliptic Curve, Diffie-Hellman, and DSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we navigate the complex landscape of quantum-safe cryptography, embracing these innovative solutions will be pivotal in upholding the integrity and confidentiality of our digital interactions in the quantum era."
